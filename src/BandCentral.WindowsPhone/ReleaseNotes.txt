- NEW Beta features (see Settings page in the app): 
   - Use 500px photo search and Bing Image of the Day as image sources
   - Cloud backup and restore favorites from cloud
- Tons of UI tweaks, improvements and replacements (e.g. The themes preview scrolls sideways to allow for more room of your Theme History)
